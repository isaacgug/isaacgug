# 👋 Howdy!

I'm Isaac, a software engineer with a passion for networks, virtualisation and automation, and continuous learning. Here’s a bit about my journey so far:

---

## 🚀 Experience

- **Boeing**  
  Worked as a Networks-focused software engineer for 3.5 years. My main toolkit included **Python** and lots of Linux. I also coached junior engineers and helped improve one of Boeing’s major networking projects.  
  Along the way, I got deep into virtualized networking—spinning up and managing Linux VMs using **QEMU** and **libvirt**. building out virtual network topologies, and scripting everything I could.

- **Haast (AI Startup)**  
  Currently working as a fullstack engineer with hopes of applying my networking and virtualisation experience where I can to help bring Haast to the next level.
