# 👋 Howdy!

I'm Isaac, a software engineer with a passion for networks, virtualisation and automation, and continuous learning. Here’s a bit about my journey so far:

---

## 🚀 Experience

- **Boeing**  
  Worked as a Networks-focused software engineer for 3.5 years. My main toolkit included **Python** and lots of Linux. I also coached junior engineers and helped improve one of Boeing’s major networking projects.  
  Along the way, I got deep into virtualized networking—spinning up and managing Linux VMs using **QEMU** and **libvirt**. building out virtual network topologies, and scripting everything I could.

- **Haast (AI Startup)**  
  Currently working as a fullstack engineer with hopes of applying my networking and virtualisation experience where I can to help bring Haast to the next level.

## 🛠️ Skills

- Networking & Network Programming
- Python (Networking tools, automation, and scripts galore)
- Virtualization: libvirt, QEMU, Linux VM orchestration

## 🌟 Highlight Projects

Right now, I'm working on two main side projects. The one I'm most excited for is B.E.P.S.I.S, an automatic backend CLI monitoring tool written in Rust.

**Stack:**
- Written primarily in Rust
- Rust orchestrator - B.E.P.S.I.S Prime
- Python agents to handle Python specific backend applications - B.E.P.S.I.S Agents 

I’m also building a web-based task planner/calendar to improve my fullstack skills and hopefully allow myself to plan my life better called GrindStone.

**Stack:**  
- Frontend: Svelte  
- Backend: Python and FastAPI  
- Database: PostgreSQL
